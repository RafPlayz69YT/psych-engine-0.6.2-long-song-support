so uhhh how to make cool songs with this thingy

soooo
first, split your song into around 23 minute sections and mark inst in sections and vocals as well
eg
Inst0.ogg
Inst1.ogg
Voices0.ogg
Voices1.ogg

etc


a value you need to know is that this is considered
1 max parts
why?
programming likes stuff starting at 0 and not 1
and im too lazy to change it
so aka if 3 audio files would be considered as 2 max parts


in the chart editor in the song section, 2 new things been added

has Extra Parts checkbox

and

maxParts number increase thing


so

the has extra Parts checkbox needs to be checked for the game to search for more parts and acknowledge them
max parts is the highest number thing i mentioned earlier
reload the audio for it to then get the audios


ok 1 thing you should keep in mind is that this will eat lots of memory so be prepared (it preloads all the extra parts for quick swapping)
reloading the audio when you're in a extra part could cause issues as im too lazy to make something for that
